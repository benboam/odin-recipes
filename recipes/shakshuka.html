    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Shakshuka is a one-pan dish of eggs poached in a spiced tomato-pepper sauce. You start by softening onion and bell pepper in olive oil with garlic, then stir in ground cumin, paprika (sweet or smoked), and a pinch of chili or harissa. Add crushed tomatoes (canned or fresh), a little salt, and let it simmer until thick and jammy. Make small wells in the sauce, crack in the eggs, cover, and cook just until the whites set and the yolks stay runny.</p>

    <p>Finish with crumbled feta, a handful of herbs (parsley, cilantro, or dill), and a drizzle of good olive oil. Serve straight from the pan with warm crusty bread or pita to scoop. You can riff with extras like spinach, olives, or chickpeas; for more heat, add more chili; for richer sauce, swirl in a spoon of tomato paste. It’s simple, cozy, and perfect any time of day.</p>
