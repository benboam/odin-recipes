    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pancakes are quick griddle-cakes made from a simple batter—flour, milk, egg, a little sugar, and baking powder—poured onto a hot, lightly greased pan. As they cook, bubbles rise and pop, the edges set, and a flip gives you a golden, tender centre with a lightly crisp surface. American-style pancakes are thick and fluffy; crêpes are thin and lacy; Scotch pancakes (drop scones) sit somewhere in between. All start the same way: whisk, rest briefly, cook, flip, stack.</p>

    <p>They’re a blank canvas for toppings and add-ins: butter and maple syrup, berries, yoghurt, lemon and sugar, honey, or chocolate chips and banana. You can go savoury too—think sweetcorn and spring onion with a dollop of sour cream, or smoked salmon and crème fraîche on crêpes. Swap in gluten-free flour, dairy-free milk, or a flax “egg” if needed, and you’ve got breakfast (or dessert) sorted.</p>
